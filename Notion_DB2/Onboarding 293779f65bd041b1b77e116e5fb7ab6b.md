# Onboarding

Owner: Arvind Narayan

Welcome to the Data Science and Analytics team. We are excited to have to onboard. Hereâ€™s how you can plan to go about your first few days on the team

**TL;DR**

1. Set up your accounts
2. Get some basic intel
3. Introduce yourself

- **Week 1:** Make sure to **sit down with your lead** in the first few days to get to know each other and talk about expectations and goals for the 1st month and the 1st quarter. Make sure to schedule your week 2 and week 4 check-ins.
- **Week 2: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. If there are doubts (from both sides): this is the time to say it. If there are severe doubts, think about scheduling another check-in next week (week 3).
- **Week 4: Have a check-in** regarding expectations and goals. It's important to come up with a few personal goals in this talk. Think about feedback you got and things you would like to achieve, learn or do at Dunder Mifflin. After this, you will receive continuous feedback and will be involved in the feedback cycle like everyone. This is also a good moment to schedule your weekly or bi-weekly 1on1's with your lead.
